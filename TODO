*Add a speciality rule to accomodate a mage or warlock tank in the profile / alt setup. Sometimes this is used in certain TBC wow classic raids.

For the roster, let's also add a visual that shows the roles filled up. Like a horizontal bar graph that shows (2) tanks. Marks the accepted roles and the open ones and the # of over.
